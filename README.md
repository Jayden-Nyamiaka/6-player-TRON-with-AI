# 6-player TRON with AI

TRON is a simple 6-player game with AI functionality modeled after the well-known TRON computer game.

## Controls

Upon entry, controls are located directly under each playable rider; if the rider is not playable, "AI" is located directly under it.

The number of players, AI, and Rounds to Win are chosen at the beginning of the game using numbered keys 0-9, backspace, and enter/return or space.

Throughout the game, 'esc' can be used to quit, 'p' can be used to pause, and 'r' can be used to restart.
